Thus, it can't gain levels or other abilities, nor can it ever react differently to a situation than you would have at the moment you conjured it if you had the knowledge it currently possesses.

It gives a monster multiple set initiative turns every round which are placed as far from each other as possible - this means the monster does not roll initiative. One of those turns (the \"Tier 1\" turn) is a normal combat turn, on which the monster can perform any basic action or attack, move up to its speed, and use any Tier 1 abilities. On all its other turns in a round, the monster can only perform a basic attack or use abilities specific to that tier, and nothing else (including moving). Tiered monsters have an action and a bonus action available on each of their turns. They only have one reaction per round, which they regain at the start of their Tier 1 turn. Recharge abilities only get recharge rolls on their corresponding tier's turn. Each of a tiered monster's turns in a round count as independent turns for the purpose of all other effects and timings which occur at the start or end of their turn.",
                "<b>Effect management</b> replaces legendary resistances, and comes in the form of abilities as diverse as the monsters that possess them. Generally, on its turn, a monster can perform an exchange (such as sacrificing HP or losing use of an ability or trait) to automatically remove an effect it's subjected to. The trade will always be in the monster's favour when the effect is completely locking it down or preventing it from participating in normal combat, but minor effects will generally not be worth the cost of such a trade-off. These sacrifices will generally still require use of an action or bonus action, so incapacitation effects remain particularly detrimental to tiered monsters."
